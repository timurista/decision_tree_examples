## Pandas
Pandas - Pandas is a tool that makes working with data structures easier. It will help us work with our labelled data. Official Website: http://pandas.pydata.org/ Numpy - Numpy is the go-to library for scientific computing. It will help us with complex math operations. Official Website: http://www.numpy.org/ Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a library for visualizing data. It will help us check that our iris data is correct, plus give us a unique understanding of the data. Official Website: https://matplotlib.org/ Scikit-Learn - Scikit is a very popular machine learning library built on Numpy, SciPy and matplotlib. It will help us classify the flowers.
